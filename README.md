Project Overview: To-Do List Web App

![Screenshot 2024-12-05 124007](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a627203d-f0ab-4ef6-9d1c-535cf766c0f0)

The To-Do List Web App is a simple and interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting them when they are no longer needed. This app is designed to be user-friendly with a clean, responsive interface, making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.

Features of the To-Do List Web App
Task Creation: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by typing into an input field and submitting the form. Each new task is added to the list dynamically.
Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on the task text, which will visually indicate the task is finished by crossing it out.
Task Deletion: Tasks can be deleted by clicking a "Delete" button next to each task, removing it from the list.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes, making it functional across mobile and desktop devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used to define the structure of the app. It provides a clean and simple layout with an input form for adding tasks and an unordered list to display them.
CSS: Applied for styling the app. It includes custom styles for the task list, buttons, and hover effects to make the app visually appealing and interactive.
JavaScript: Provides the interactive functionality for the app. It enables task creation, marking tasks as completed, and task deletion. The JavaScript is responsible for handling events, such as form submission and user interactions.
How the App Works
Adding a Task: When the user types a task into the input field and clicks the "Add Task" button, the task is added to an unordered list on the page.
Marking a Task as Completed: Users can click on the task text, and it will be struck through, indicating that the task is completed. The task’s appearance changes to visually show its completion.
Deleting a Task: Next to each task, there is a "Delete" button. Clicking this button removes the task from the list entirely.
User Interface (UI) and Design
Clean and Simple: The app uses a minimalist design, with clear separation between tasks. The tasks are displayed in a list with a simple, modern look.
Responsive: The app is optimized for mobile and desktop devices, ensuring a seamless experience regardless of screen size.
Visual Feedback: Tasks that are marked as completed are visually distinguished by a strikethrough effect, and deleted tasks are removed from the UI immediately.
Installation and Usage
Download or Clone the project repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to start using the app.
To add a task, type the task name in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
Click on a task to mark it as completed, and click the "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
Potential Improvements and Future Features
Local Storage: Store tasks in the browser’s local storage so that tasks persist even when the user refreshes the page.
Task Prioritization: Allow users to assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
Task Categorization: Enable users to categorize tasks (e.g., Work, Personal, etc.).
Task Editing: Allow users to edit the text of tasks after they have been added.
User Authentication: Implement a sign-in feature for users to save their tasks across multiple devices.
Summary
This To-Do List Web App serves as a simple yet functional solution for managing daily tasks. It provides essential task management features, a user-friendly interface, and an interactive experience. While the app is simple in its current form, there is a wide range of features that can be added to enhance its functionality, such as task persistence and categorization, making it an ideal starting point for further enhancements.
